## Brief overview
Guidelines for analyzing different approaches when developing solutions, focusing on best practices evaluation and balanced comparison of alternatives.

## Approach analysis
- Always evaluate multiple solution approaches before implementation
- Consider industry best practices for the specific technology and domain
- Assess trade-offs between different architectural patterns and design choices

## Pros and cons evaluation
- Present balanced analysis of advantages and disadvantages for each approach
- Include performance, maintainability, scalability, and complexity considerations
- Highlight long-term implications of technical decisions

## Decision rationale
- Provide clear reasoning for recommended approaches based on evidence
- Explain why certain options are preferred over others in given contexts
- Consider project-specific constraints and requirements when evaluating options
